SimQN is a discrete-event based network simulation platform for quantum networks. SimQN enables large-scale investigations, including QKD protocols, entanglement distributions protocols, and routing algorithms, resource allocation schemas in quantum networks. For example, users can use SimQN to design routing algorithms for better QKD performance. For more information, please refer to the Documents.
SimQN is a Python3 library for quantum networking simulation. It is designed to be general propose.</description></item><item><title>About Us</title><link>https://qnlab-ustc.com/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 13:27:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://qnlab-ustc.com/about/</guid><description>To the future of quantum era Nowadays, we are on the cusp of a new age of technology that promises to revolutionize the way we compute, communicate, and secure information. Quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at the subatomic level, has long been recognized as a powerful tool for information processing. The advancements of quantum mechanics have the potential to solve problems that were previously impossible to solve with classical networks and computers, to provide unprecedented levels of security for our communications, and to create entirely new industries and fields of study.</description></item><item><title>Building a Large-Scale and Wide-Area Quantum Internet Based on an OSI-Alike Model</title><link>https://qnlab-ustc.com/highlights/china-communication/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qnlab-ustc.com/highlights/china-communication/</guid><description>The theory and experiment of quantum information have been studied extensively in recent years, and the feasibility of quantum communication has been proved. Although the fundamental technology is not yet mature, research on quantum internet should be conducted. To implement quantum internet, an architecture that describes how quantum nodes are linked to form networks and how protocol functions are vertically composed need to be developed urgently. In this paper, we present a novel design of a cluster-based structure to describe how quantum nodes are interconnected, and how the structure can improve the performance of qubit transmission and reduce the network complexity.</description></item><item><title>News</title><link>https://qnlab-ustc.com/news/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qnlab-ustc.com/news/</guid><description>2023.7 our paper &amp;ldquo;Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Networks: Mechanics, Enabling Technologies, Challenges, and Research Directions&amp;rdquo; is accepted by IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials! 2023.6 our paper &amp;ldquo;Q-DDCA: Decentralized Dynamic Congestion Avoid Routing in Large-Scale Quantum Networks&amp;rdquo; is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Networking! 2023.5 our paper &amp;ldquo;Swapping-based Entanglement Routing Design for Congestion Mitigation in Quantum Networks&amp;rdquo; is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management! 2023.2 our paper &amp;ldquo;A Segment-based Multipath Distribution Method in Partially-Trusted Relay Quantum Networks&amp;rdquo; is accepted by IEEE Communications Magazine!</description></item><item><title>Our Team</title><link>https://qnlab-ustc.com/team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qnlab-ustc.com/team/</guid><description>Scientific Conunselor Jun Lu Professor
