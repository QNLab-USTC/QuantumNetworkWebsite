The key difficulties lie in achieving spontaneous and precise control over the entanglement distribution procedure, as multiple nodes need to reach a consensus on how to perform it. From the network aspect, allocating link-layer entangled pairs as resources to achieve high efficiency is also challenging. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized Reliable Entanglement Distribution Protocol (REDP) for large-scale networks.</description></item><item><title>SimQN: a Network-layer Simulator for the Quantum Network Investigation</title><link>https://qnlab-ustc.com/highlights/simqn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 11:39:58 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://qnlab-ustc.com/highlights/simqn/</guid><description/></item><item><title>SimQN: a Network-layer Simulator for the Quantum Network Investigation</title><link>https://qnlab-ustc.com/projects/simqn/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 13:40:06 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://qnlab-ustc.com/projects/simqn/</guid><description>Welcome to SimQN&amp;rsquo;s documentation. SimQN is a discrete-event based network simulation platform for quantum networks. SimQN enables large-scale investigations, including QKD protocols, entanglement distributions protocols, and routing algorithms, resource allocation schemas in quantum networks. For example, users can use SimQN to design routing algorithms for better QKD performance. For more information, please refer to the Documents.

Quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at the subatomic level, has long been recognized as a powerful tool for information processing. The advancements of quantum mechanics have the potential to solve problems that were previously impossible to solve with classical networks and computers, to provide unprecedented levels of security for our communications, and to create entirely new industries and fields of study.</description></item><item><title>Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Networks: Mechanics, Enabling Technologies, Challenges, and Research Directions</title><link>https://qnlab-ustc.com/highlights/ieee_commu_sur_tur/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://qnlab-ustc.com/highlights/ieee_commu_sur_tur/</guid><description>Quantum applications offer significant advantages over their classical counterparts primarily due to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, especially quantum entanglement. To harness the full potential and broaden the scope of quantum applications, it becomes imperative to establish entanglement-assisted quantum networks by connecting multiple quantum nodes through physical channels. Quantum networks have shown promise in terms of improving the overall functional benefits of the Internet and enabling applications with no counterpart in the classical world, which is a breakthrough technology towards the unimaginable future.</description></item><item><title>Building a Large-Scale and Wide-Area Quantum Internet Based on an OSI-Alike Model</title><link>https://qnlab-ustc.com/highlights/china-communication/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qnlab-ustc.com/highlights/china-communication/</guid><description>The theory and experiment of quantum information have been studied extensively in recent years, and the feasibility of quantum communication has been proved. Although the fundamental technology is not yet mature, research on quantum internet should be conducted. To implement quantum internet, an architecture that describes how quantum nodes are linked to form networks and how protocol functions are vertically composed need to be developed urgently. In this paper, we present a novel design of a cluster-based structure to describe how quantum nodes are interconnected, and how the structure can improve the performance of qubit transmission and reduce the network complexity.</description></item><item><title>News</title><link>https://qnlab-ustc.com/news/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qnlab-ustc.com/news/</guid><description>2023.12, our paper &amp;ldquo;REDP: Reliable Entanglement Distribution Protocol Design for Large-scale Quantum Networks&amp;rdquo; is accepted by IEEE Journal on Seclected Areas in Communications!
