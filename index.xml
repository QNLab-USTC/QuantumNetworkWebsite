Quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at the subatomic level, has long been recognized as a powerful tool for information processing. The advancements of quantum mechanics have the potential to solve problems that were previously impossible to solve with classical networks and computers, to provide unprecedented levels of security for our communications, and to create entirely new industries and fields of study.</description></item><item><title>Our Team</title><link>https://qnlab-ustc.com/team/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 13:25:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://qnlab-ustc.com/team/</guid><description>People Scientific Conunselor Lu Jun Qibin Sun Nenghai Yu Staff Kaiping Xue E-mail

Although the fundamental technology is not yet mature, research on quantum internet should be conducted. To implement quantum internet, an architecture that describes how quantum nodes are linked to form networks and how protocol functions are vertically composed need to be developed urgently. In this paper, we present a novel design of a cluster-based structure to describe how quantum nodes are interconnected, and how the structure can improve the performance of qubit transmission and reduce the network complexity.</description></item></channel></rss>
